# Kumoricon Registration

Attendee registration management system. Think of it as a mix of attendee registration, point-of-sale, badge printing, 
and staff management for [Kumoricon](https://www.kumoricon.org/).

- Preregistered attendee check in and badge printing
- At event registration and badge printing
- Guest of Honor badge printing
- Staff check in, photo and signature capture, and badge printing
- Attendee information search
- Till reporting
- Staff management/reporting

This system has been in use since 2019, replacing its [predecessor](https://github.com/kumoregdev/kumoreg), though
much of workflow and schema is the same.
